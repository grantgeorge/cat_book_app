Codeigniter / AngularJS Tutorial
=================================

This tutorial demonstrates how to setup a basic Codeigniter PHP API and
AngularJS frontend.

You can work through it on your own by checking out different branches
that correspond to different parts of the tutorial.

Ex: git checkout part1-1 (basic API scaffolding)

Eventually, we'll add steps to work through the tutorial. For now, you can
compare the diff between different parts to get an idea of what's happening
at each part of the tutorial.

Ex: git diff part1-1 part1-2
